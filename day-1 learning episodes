what is #include
Preprocessor Directive
#include <stdio.h>
is a directive to the C preprocessor. Lines beginning with # are processed by the prepro-
cessor before compilation. Line 3 tells the preprocessor to include the contents of the stan-
dard input/output header ( <stdio.h> ) in the program. This header contains information
used by the compiler when compiling calls to standard input/output library functions such
as printf
so #include is a basic keyword which heads the programme to be compiled.

p1.c: In function ‘input’:

a1.c:6:13: warning: format ‘%d’ expects argument of type ‘int *’, but argument 2 has type ‘int’ [-Wformat=]
     scanf("%d",a);

a1.c:7:12: error: expected expression before ‘int’
     return int a;

puts( "Enter seven integers: " );
scanf( "%d%i%i%i%o%u%x", &a, &b, &c, &d, &e, &f, &g );
The % in this context is treated by scanf
(and printf as we’ll see) as a special character that begins a conversion specifier. The second
argument of scanf begins with an ampersand ( & )—called the address operator
& is address operator which is used for special characters such as %

EXPERIMENT:# NOT WRITTEN
When # is not written
E492: Not an editor command: qw!
The compiler did not compile the code.
so,maybe the compiler starts compiling after reading #

#include <stdio.h>
is a directive to the C preprocessor. Lines beginning with # are processed by the prepro-
cessor before compilation. Line tells the preprocessor to include the contents of the stan-
dard input/output header ( <stdio.h> ) in the program. This header contains information used by the compiler when compiling calls to standard input/output library functions such
as printf .

What is a preprocessor?
C has preprocessors...include,define etc are preprocessors
What is a Preprocessor Directive?
pg525
The preprocessor executes before a program is compiled.
• All preprocessor directives begin with # .
• Only whitespace characters and comments may appear before a preprocessor directive on a line.

WHAT IS A TOKEN?
pg359
Function strtok is used to break a string into a series of tokens. A token is a
sequence of characters separated by delimiters (usually spaces or punctuation marks, but a
delimiter can be any character). For example, in a line of text, each word can be considered
a token, and the spaces and punctuation separating the words can be considered delimiters.
Did not understand completely , but it might be a unit of the program.
A programming token is the basic component of source code . Characters are categorized as one of five classes of tokens that
describe their functions (constants, identifiers, operators, reserved words, and separators) in accordance with the rules of the
programming language.
A token is the smallest element of a program that is meaningful to the compiler

add.c:2:16: error: expected ‘;’, ‘,’ or ‘)’ before ‘*’ token
int input(int a*,int b*)
It is (int *a,int *b); the * symbol should be use dbefore the variale and not after the variable.
syntax error,small confusion.

add.c: In function ‘input’:
add.c:5:8: error: expected expression before ‘%’ token
scanf(%d,a);
^
add.c:7:8: error: expected expression before ‘%’ token
scanf(%d,b);
^
"%d" should be written and not %d alone.
syntax error,forgot to add the " "

What is void?
int main( void ) is a part of every C program. The parentheses after main indicate that main is a program
building block called a function. C programs contain one or more functions, one of which
must be main . Every program in C begins executing at the function main . Functions can
return information. The keyword int to the left of main indicates that main “returns” an
integer (whole-number) value.
Functions also can receive information when they’re called upon to execute. The void in parentheses here
means that main does not receive any information.
