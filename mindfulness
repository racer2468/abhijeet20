what is mindfulness?
Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one's attention to experiences occurring in the present moment.
Mindfulness means maintaining a moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings,
bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, through a gentle, nurturing lens.
Mindfulness also involves acceptance,
meaning that we pay attention to our thoughts and feelings without judging them—without believing,
for instance, that there’s a “right” or “wrong” way to think or feel in a given moment.
When we practice mindfulness, our thoughts tune into what we’re sensing
in the present moment rather than rehashing the past or imagining the future.
