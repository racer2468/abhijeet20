what is flow psychology?
Flow  is state of mind,where the person is totally immersed in the act without  being aware of surrounding.
The person enjoys the activity in which he/she is involved in,
since he/she has goal to achieve & a  activity about which they are passionate & are devoted to.
The person does not find any difficulty or any barriers between them & goal.                        
When the people are involved in the activity they won’t be disturbed by the other things that are not related to their work,
they won’t get distracted by other 
thoughts they have total control on their mind.
If we are interested in playing games  we won’t
Feel tired ,we don’t care about others’ comments & we will 
Find some kind of joy & relaxation in that
