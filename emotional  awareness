what is emotional awareness?
Emotional awareness is the ability to recognise and make sense of not just your own emotions, but also those of others.
Example: You are in a room. Another person enters.
At first you don't see them, but maybe you realize there is a new noise. 
You turn and then you see the person and become aware they are in the room.
Through thought, our feelings can point us to the  causes of our negative feelings and to possible solutions.
But if we fail to acknowledge our negative feelings, 
won't be able to focus our attention on the problem that needs to be solved.
Many people try to stop themselves from feeling their negative emotions. They may use drugs and alcohol.
They may use entertainment and distraction. They may also try to simply deny the existence of their negative feelings.
Even education, memorization, intellectual or religious pursuits can serve to stop us from acknowledging our feelings.
The more we are aware of our feelings, the better chance we have of predicting how we will feel in the future. 
When we know how we feel we know what we enjoy doing and who we enjoy doing it with. We know who we feel safe with, 
who we feel accepted by and understood by.
