An array is a collection of fixed number of values of a single type. For example: if you want to store 100 integers in sequence,
you can create an array for it.int data[100];
The size and type of arrays cannot be changed after its declaration.
Arrays are of two types:
-One dimensional arrays
-Multidimensional arrays.
How to declare arrays?
data_type array_name[array_size];float mark[5];
Here, we declared an array, mark, of floating-point type and size 5. Meaning, it can hold 5 floating-point values.
How to initialize an array?
It's possible to initialize an array during declaration. 
For example,int mark[5] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9};
