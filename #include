what is #include
#include
Preprocessor Directive
Line 3
#include <stdio.h>
is a directive to the C preprocessor. Lines beginning with # are processed by the prepro-
cessor before compilation. Line 3 tells the preprocessor to include the contents of the stan-
dard input/output header ( <stdio.h> ) in the program. This header contains information
used by the compiler when compiling calls to standard input/output library functions such
as printf
so #include is a basic keyword which heads the programme to be compiled.
